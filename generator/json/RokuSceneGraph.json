      "description": "The Task node class allows you to specify a function to be spawned in a different thread, and run asynchronously with respect to both the scene rendering thread and the main application thread. A Task node also allows you to run functions that cannot be run in Scene Graph node or component, typically BrightScript code functions involving operations such as reading data from servers and file system manipulation. (You also cannot, and should not, run functions in a Scene Graph application for operations that are functionally the same as Scene Graph nodes and components, such as playing videos.) A list of all the BrightScript functions and components that cannot be used in Scene Graph applications or can only be used in a Task node can be found in Scene Graph BrightScript Support.A Task node is typically used to read data from a server to create a ContentNode node to configure a Scene Graph node or component (see ). A Task node used for this purpose can be thought of as a content reader. Since ContentNode nodes are required to configure many components rendered in a scene, such as lists, panels, and grids, and you will generally want to read the data for those types of nodes from your server, you should create a Task node as a content reader for each of those components that you use in your scene. The Task node class was designed with three general development use cases:A new Task node object is created for each asynchronous operation. The input data needed for the operation is set in the Task node object \u003cinterface\u003e fields in the render thread, along with an observer of the output \u003cinterface\u003e field data, and the Task node control field is set to RUN. After the output data is returned to the render thread, the Task node object is not used again. A Task node object is used multiple times for several identical asynchronous operations. In this case, the input data for each operation is set in the existing Task node object, with another observer for the output \u003cinterface\u003e field data, and the Task node control field is again set to RUN. This may be more efficient than creating a new Task node object for each of the identical operations. A Task node observes its input \u003cinterface\u003e fields using the port form of observeField(), and returns output data with each field change. In this case, the Task node acts like a continuous server.Since Task nodes launch asynchronous threads, and have no provisions for locks and mutexes, you must be careful to avoid race, deadlock, and other asynchronous thread errors. Here are a few tips for using Task nodes:Avoid accessing files which must be persistent before thread completion, to avoid a subsequent Task node or other thread access of the same file before the thread completes. It is easier and safer to use a dynamically-created string or other data object to hold temporary thread data to avoid having a subsequent or existing thread overwrite and corrupt the data. Be very careful if you access any object in a Task node that may exist in another thread. It is better to completely separate all objects in any other possible thread from the Task node thread by setting the \u003cinterface\u003e fields of the Task node with copies of the minimum amount of data needed to run the thread. In the Task node init() function, perform the minimum required amount of initialization of the Task node and any included thread functions. If you intend to trigger an asynchronous task based on a Task node input \u003cinterface\u003e field change, in many cases, you should only set up the observer for the field in init(). Use the port form of observeField() rather than the onChange attribute. This will avoid triggering the thread in response to a render thread event before the Task node observers are set up. It is more efficient to use a persistent Task node that is triggered by an \u003cinterface\u003e field change than to create a new Task node every time a particular asynchronous thread is required. If needed, you can communicate that the particular asynchronous thread is no longer required through an \u003cinterface\u003e field as well, either through the triggering field, or a special field used for control of the Task node. You can use a single Task node object to run any number of different asynchronous threads by setting the functionName field to the Task node function you want before setting the control field to RUN. If you do not use the input data \u003cinterface\u003e fields to trigger running the thread, this is equivalent to calling an asynchronous function, and passing the input data fields as arguments to the function. The output data \u003cinterface\u003e fields can likewise be considered as the return value of a asynchronous function call, but to avoid blocking you must observe the fields, or the state field, as a callback event to handle the results in the calling thread.Also review Scene Graph Threads for in-depth information on using Task nodes most efficiently.

This may be more efficient than creating a new \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node object for each of the identical operations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node observes its input \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e fields using the port form of \n \u003cac:link\u003e\n  \u003cri:page ri:content-title\u003d\"ifSGNodeField\" /\u003e\n  \u003cac:link-body\u003e\n   \u003ccode\u003eobserveField()\u003c/code\u003e\n  \u003c/ac:link-body\u003e\n \u003c/ac:link\u003e, and returns output data with each field change. In this case, the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node acts like a continuous server.\u003c/li\u003eSince \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e nodes launch asynchronous threads, and have no provisions for locks and mutexes, you must be careful to avoid race, deadlock, and other asynchronous thread errors. Here are a few tips for using \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e nodes:\u003cli\u003eAvoid accessing\u0026nbsp;files\u0026nbsp;which must be persistent\u0026nbsp;before\u0026nbsp;thread completion, to avoid a subsequent \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node or other thread access of the same file before the thread completes. It is easier and safer to use a dynamically-created string or other data object to hold temporary thread data to avoid having a subsequent or existing thread overwrite and corrupt the data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe very careful if you access any object in a \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node that may exist in another thread. It is better to completely separate all objects in any other possible thread from the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node thread by setting the \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e fields of the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node with copies of the minimum amount of data needed to run the thread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ccode\u003einit()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e function, perform the minimum required amount of initialization of the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node and any included thread functions. If you intend to trigger an asynchronous task based on a \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node input \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e field change, in many cases, you should only set up the observer for the field in \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ccode\u003einit()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse the port form of \n \u003cac:link\u003e\n  \u003cri:page ri:content-title\u003d\"ifSGNodeField\" /\u003e\n  \u003cac:link-body\u003e\n   \u003ccode\u003eobserveField()\u003c/code\u003e\n  \u003c/ac:link-body\u003e\n \u003c/ac:link\u003e rather than the \u003ccode\u003eonChange\u003c/code\u003e attribute. This will avoid triggering the thread in response to a render thread event before the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node observers are set up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is more efficient to use a persistent\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node that is triggered by an \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e field change than to create a new \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node every time a particular asynchronous thread is required. If needed, you can communicate that the particular asynchronous thread is no longer required through an \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e field as well, either through the triggering field, or a special field used for control of the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou can use a single \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node object to run any number of different asynchronous threads by setting the \u003ccode\u003efunctionName\u003c/code\u003e field to the \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e node function you want before setting the \u003ccode\u003econtrol\u003c/code\u003e field to \u003ccode\u003eRUN\u003c/code\u003e. If you do not use the input data \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e fields to trigger running the thread, this is equivalent to calling an asynchronous function, and passing the input data fields as arguments to the function. The output data \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e fields can likewise be considered as the return value of a asynchronous function call, but to avoid blocking you must observe the fields, or the \u003ccode\u003estate\u003c/code\u003e field, as a callback event to handle the results in the calling thread.\u003c/li\u003eAlso review \n\u003cac:link\u003e\n \u003cri:page ri:content-title\u003d\"Scene Graph Threads\" /\u003e\n \u003cac:link-body\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003eScene Graph Threads\u003c/strong\u003e\n \u003c/ac:link-body\u003e\n\u003c/ac:link\u003e for in-depth information on using \u003cstrong\u003eTask\u003c/strong\u003e nodes most efficiently. \u0026nbsp;",

The bulletText and graphicUrl fields of the Dialog node should not be set. If those Dialog node fields are set, the layout of the dialog will likely not look correct.Also, the KeyboardDialog node class inherits the behavior of the interrnal Keyboard node when the Options remote key is pressed. The Keyboard node class toggles between uppercase and lowercase letters when the Options remote key is pressed, to speed the entry of mixed-case strings by the user. Therefore, the optionsDialog field of the Dialog node class should not be set to true.Typically, you will want to set the KeyboardDialog node title field to prompt the user to enter the string, and add \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons by setting the Dialog node buttons field to [ \"OK\", \"Cancel\" ], then observe the Dialog node class buttonSelected field to react when the user presses one of those buttons. At any time, the text field can be accessed to obtain the string entered by the user.Another typical usage of the KeyboardDialog node class adds a \"Hide Text\" button, with an observer function set up to toggle the secureMode field of the Keyboard node internal TextEditBox node (that is, by toggling the value of the keyboard.textEditBox.secureMode field).",

The Label node class supports many options including:Specifying the color of the font Specifying the font to be used by specifying a TrueType/OpenType font file Single line and multi-line text Horizontal and vertical alignment Justification Automatic ellipsizing of the text based on the specified width and number of linesAlignmentThe Label node uses the horizAlign and vertAlign fields to allow you to position the rendered text relative to a specified bounding rectangle.Horizontal AlignmentThe horizAlign field allows you to position text horizontally relative to the computed width of the label. The computed width is determined in one of two ways:If the width field is greater than zero, the computed width is the value of the width field. If the width field is equal to zero, the computed width is the rendered width of the text.There are three possible values for the horizAlign field:left The left edge of the text is drawn at the 0 x-coordinate position of the Label node local coordinate system. center The horizontal center of each line of text is positioned at the x-coordinate corresponding to half the computed width of the Label node local coordinate system. right The right edge of each line of text is positioned at x-coordinate position corresponding to the computed width of the Label node local coordinate system.Note that if the width field is equal to zero, a single line of text will be rendered (see  for more details). In that case, all three values of the horizAlign field have the same result, since the computed width equals the rendered width of the text. Vertical AlignmentThe vertAlign field allows you to position text vertically relative to the computed height of the label. The computed height is determined in one of four ways, which in some cases depend on the values set in the numLines and maxLines fields:If the height field is greater than zero, the computed height is the value of the height field. In this case, the numLines and maxLines field values are ignored. If the height field is zero and the numLines field is greater than zero, the computed height is the height required to render the number of lines specified by the numLines field value. Note that the computed height is set to the height required to render the number of lines even if the rendered text contains fewer lines. For example, if the numLines field value is 4, and the rendered text only occupies two lines, the computed height is still equal to the height required to render four lines. In this case, the value of the maxLines field is ignored. If both the height and numLines field values are set to zero, and the maxLines field value is greater than zero, the rendered text will be limited to the number of lines set in the maxLines field value. In this case, the computed height is the height of the rendered text, but that text will be limited to no more than the number of lines set in the maxLines field value. For example, if the maxLines field value is 3, and the rendered text only occupies two lines, the computed height is the height required to render two lines of text. If the maxLines field value is 3, and the rendered text would occupy five lines, only three lines are drawn, and the computed height is the height required to render those three lines. If the height, numLines and maxLines field values are all zero, the computed height is the height of the rendered text.There are three possible values for the vertAlign field:top The top edge of the text is drawn at 0 y-coordinate position of the Label node local coordinate system. center The vertical center of the rendered text is positioned at y-coordinate position corresponding to half the computed height of the Label node local coordinate system. bottom The text is drawn so that bottom edge of the rendered text is positioned at the y-coordinate position corresponding to the computed height of the Label node local coordinate system.Note that if the computed height equals the actual height of the rendered text (such as when the height and numLines field values are both zero), all three values of the vertAlign field have the same result, since the computed height equals the rendered height of the text. Alignment ExampleThe following image shows a Rectangle node with a width of 1000 pixels and a height of 500 pixels. The Rectangle node has nine Label child nodes. Each Label child node has its width field value set to 1000 and its height field value set to 500. All nine combinations of the horizAlign and vertAlign fields are used to position the labels relative to the 1000x500 bounding rectangle.WrappingThe wrap field is used to control how the text is broken into multiple lines. The two possible field values are true and false. wrap \u003d falseIn this case, a single line of text will be displayed.If the width field value is zero, and the text does not contain any newline characters, the entire text string is rendered. If the text contains newline characters, the part of the text up to the first newline character is rendered.If the width field value is greater than zero, the text is truncated or ellipsized so only the portion of text is rendered that fits within the specified width. wrap \u003d trueIn this case, if the width field value is greater than zero, the text is broken into several lines, each of which has width no larger than the computed width. Each newline character in the text results in a new line of text. Also, the text is broken into lines at any space or hyphen character. If any word in the text exceeds the computed width, it is broken into lines arbitrarily.If the width field value is zero and the wrap field value is true, no text is rendered.The actual numbers of lines displayed is dependent upon the values set in the height, numLines and maxLines fields.If the height field value is greater than zero, the text is broken into lines based on the value of the width field, but only the number of lines that fit into the specified height are rendered. If the displayPartialLines field value is set to true (the default), only full lines of text are rendered. If the displayPartialLines field value is false, the top or bottom line of text may be clipped vertically.If the height field value is zero, and the numLines field value is greater than zero, the text is broken into lines based on the value of the width field, and up to the number of lines of text set in the numLines field value are rendered.If both the height and numLines field values are zero, and the maxLines field value is greater than zero, the text is broken into lines based on the value of the width field, and no more than the number of lines of text set in the maxLines field value are rendered.

When the \u003cstrong\u003eButtonGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node has the focus, the button in the group that has the focus will display the \u003ccode\u003efocusBitmapUri\u003c/code\u003e bitmap as its background. When the \u003cstrong\u003eButtonGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node does not have the focus, it remembers which button in the group had the focus and sets that button \u003ccode\u003eshowFocusFootprint\u003c/code\u003e field to \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, causing it to a render a \"footprint\" bitmap as a visual indicator that it will be the focused button when the \u003cstrong\u003eButtonGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node receives the focus again. All other buttons in the \u003cstrong\u003eButtonGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node do not display a background image.When a \u003cstrong\u003eButton\u003c/strong\u003e node is created that is not a child of a \u003cstrong\u003eButtonGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node, typically the \u003ccode\u003eshowFootprintfield\u003c/code\u003e field should be set to \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, so that the button always displays a background image.",

Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the fraction of the animation progress. The keyframe fields of the interpolator are key, the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and keyValue, the value that the field should have at that fraction of the animation.For example, if a ColorFieldInterpolator node had three keyframes:0.0, 0xFF0000FF (red) 0.4, 0x00FF00FF (green) 1.0, 0x0000FFFF (blue)When the interpolator fraction field value was 0.0 (that is, 0%), the color field value would be set to red. When the fraction field value was 0.4 (that is, 40%), the color field value would be set to green. When the fraction field value was 1.0 (that is, 100%), the color field value would be set to blue.For values of the fraction field between 0.0 and 0.4 (such as 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to a color halfway between red and green. Similarly, when the fraction field value is between the second and third keys (that is, between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values of the second and third keyframes.If the first keyframe has a key field fraction value greater than zero, then the field value is equal to the keyValue field value of the first keyframe until the fraction field value reaches the first keyframe key field fraction value. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key field fraction value less than one, the color field value is set to the keyValue field value of the last keyframe, from when the fraction field value equals the last keyframe key field fraction value percentage, and will not change as the fraction field value increases from that value to 1.0.The ColorFieldInterpolator node class works in the HSV color space. Doing the interpolation in the HSV color space produces the most intuitive, visually pleasing results when animating color values.Note that while linear interpolation is used to compute the keyValue field values for fraction field values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction field values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.

This allows entire branches of the scene graph to fade in and out by animating the opacity of the node at the root of the branch."

Most typically, this is used to animate the (x,y) coordinates of a node\u0027s translation field.All field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation\u0027s progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.For example, if a Vector2DFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, [0.0, 0.0]), (0.4, [500.0, 0.0]) and (1.0, [500, 200.0]), then when the interpolator\u0027s fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to [0.0, 0.0]. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to [500.0, 0.0]. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to [500.0, 200.0].For values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to [250.0, 0.0] (halfway between the point [0.0, 0.0] and [200.0, 0.0]. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.For this example, if the field being interpolated were the translation field of a Poster node parented to the Scene node, the Poster would originally be positioned with its top/left corner at the upper, left corner of the screen. As the animation proceeded from 0% to 40% complete, the Poster would slide horizontally to the right until it\u0027s top/left corner was at x\u003d500.0, y\u003d0.0. As the animation continued from 40% to 100% complete, the Poster would slide vertically down until its top/left corner was at x\u003d500.0, y\u003d200.0.If the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe\u0027s key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe\u0027s key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.Note that while linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue\u0027s for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.

These labels are automatically positioned and sized appropriately.

This mechanism is enabled or disabled by setting the createNextPanelOnItemFocus field to true or false.createNextPanelOnItemFocus should be set to true when a new right panel should be displayed each time the list\u0027s focused item changes. For example, in the Roku Homescreen, when you navigate up/down the Settings list, a new right panel is displayed that contains information about the currently focused list item. createNextPanelOnItemFocus should be set to false when the right panel should not change in response to the list\u0027s focus changes. When the create next panel mechanism is enabled and the user presses the up or down arrow key, the panel to the right of the ListPanel smoothly fades out, then when the user releases the arrow key, a new right panel is created, added to the PanelSet and smoothly faded in. To implement this, the ListPanel automatically triggers the fade out of the right panel when the up or down arrow key is pressed. When the arrow key is released, the ListPanel will set the createNextPanelIndex field to the index into the list\u0027s content that corresponds to the newly focused list item. In response to the createNextPanelIndex field being set, the ListPanel\u0027s control logic must be written to mmediately create the Panel node for the new right panel and set the nextPanel field to that Panel. The Panel creation must occur in the main scene graph render thread.The createNextPanelIndex field is guaranteed to be set exactly once whenever a new right panel needs to be created and populated with the data that corresponds to the specified index. This may happen when the ListPanel\u0027s data is changed, in response to up or down arrow key releases, or when the PanelSet\u0027s moves the focus onto the ListPanel from the left.For efficiency, sometimes the control logic for the ListPanel may create and hold onto Panel pointers internally so that the next Panel does not have to be newly created each the createNextPanelIndex field is set. If this is done, it is important to never reuse the current Panel node, as that Panel may still be fading out when the new next Panel needs to be created. A typical use case, where all the right Panels are identical other than the data they display, is to create a single pair of Panel nodes and alternate between them each time the createNextPanelIndex field is set, updating the panel data based on the specified list index.LabelList Specific UsageNotesIf you set the list field to a LabelList node, the default values for the itemSize, itemSpacing, numRows and translation fields for the LabelList will be automatically set to the recommended default values for Roku channels. By default, the panel will use the \"narrow\" panelSize. It is possible to override these default values, but in most cases, that will not be necessary.MarkupList Specific Usage NotesIf you set the list field to a MarkupList node, because the MarkupList is by nature custom, you will generally need to set the MarkupList\u0027s itemSize, itemSpacing and numRows fields.

      "description": "The FloatFieldInterpolator node class specifies a keyframe animation sequence to be applied to a floating point field of a node (such as, an opacity, width or height value.)All field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation\u0027s progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.For example, if a FloatFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, 10.0), (0.4, 200.0) and (1.0, 87.0), then when the interpolator\u0027s fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to 10.0. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to 200.0. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to 87.0.For values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to 10.0 + 0.5 * (10.0 + 200.0) \u003d 105.0. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.If the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe\u0027s key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe\u0027s key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.Note that while linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue\u0027s for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",
      "descriptionHTML": "The \u003cstrong\u003eFloatFieldInterpolator\u003c/strong\u003e node class specifies a keyframe animation sequence to be applied to a floating point field of a node (such as,\u0026nbsp;an opacity, width or height value.)All field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an \u003cstrong\u003eAnimation\u003c/strong\u003e node. As the animation progresses, it sets the \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation\u0027s progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.For example, if a \u003cstrong\u003eFloatFieldInterpolator\u003c/strong\u003e had three keyframes, (0.0, 10.0), (0.4, 200.0) and (1.0, 87.0), then when the interpolator\u0027s \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to 10.0. When \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to 200.0. When \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to 87.0.For values of \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to 10.0 + 0.5 * (10.0 + 200.0) \u003d 105.0. Similarly, when \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.If the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e reaches the first keyframe\u0027s key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e equals the the last keyframe\u0027s key percentage and will not change as \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e increases from that value to 1.0.Note that while linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue\u0027s for \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the \u003cem\u003efraction\u003c/em\u003e values computed by the \u003cstrong\u003eAnimation\u003c/strong\u003e node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

      "description": "The ContentNode node class allows you to specify the data used to configure a node or component. Many nodes and components require a ContentNode node as the specification of their content field in order to be properly configured. In general, lists, grids, and panels require a ContentNode node for configuration. The data included in a ContentNode node can be data such as the text for labels in the node or component, and the spacing between items in a list, grid, or panel, including data to create custom lists, grids, and panels. The reference information for every node or component that requires a ContentNode node includes a section that details the requirements of the ContentNode node for that node or component.ContentNode nodes defined as the specification for a node or component content field are typically structured as one ContentNode parent node, with a hierarchy of child nodes that specify the actual data, and sections of data if needed. For example, a node can have several sections that divide the entire list, each with their own section heading, and specific items in that section of the list. The ContentNode node for that LabelList node should have two levels of child ContentNode nodes, one level for the data to configure the list sections, and then another level of child ContentNode nodes for the data for each item in that list section.A ContentNode node can also be used to specify the data for custom components with defined interfaces, and for nodes and components that require Content Meta-Data. Also, you should use a ContentNode node for complex structures of data for your application rather than associative arrays. ContentNode node objects are passed by reference in the application, while associative array objects are copied. For large complex data structures, passing ContentNode node objects is much quicker than passing the equivalent associative array object. You can use associative arrays for simpler data structures with just a few fixed members.All of the attributes listed in Content Meta-Data can be set as fields in a Content node. However, when creating a Content node, the fields themselves are not created until the valid attributes are set as fields, using either assignment (\u003d), or set using setField() or setFields().Creating ContentNode NodesTo create a ContentNode node object and populate it with data, you can define the ContentNode node in XML markup, or create it using BrightScript. In both cases, you will usually be first creating or defining a parent ContentNode node, then creating or defining children ContentNode nodes below the parent, with possibly other levels of children ContentNode nodes.As an example, to define a ContentNode node with one level of children ContentNode nodes, you should generally:\u003cContentNode role\u003d or id\u003d \u003e   \u003cContentNode content_meta-data_attribute \u003d \"attribute\" ... /\u003e   ... \u003c/ContentNode\u003eThe parent ContentNode node is defined with either an XML role attribute or an id field, depending on how you want to assign or use the content data. For the nodes classes that have a content field that is to be assigned a ContentNode node, such as LabelList nodes, the parent ContentNode node should be defined as a child node of the node:\u003cLabelList  id \u003d \"labellist\" \u003e   \u003cContentNode  role \u003d \"content\" \u003e     \u003cContentNode title \u003d \"Renderable Nodes\" description \u003d \"Basic Nodes That Show Things\" /\u003e     \u003cContentNode title \u003d \"Z-Order/Parent-Child\" description \u003d \"Scene Graph Tree Order Matters\" /\u003e     \u003cContentNode title \u003d \"Animations\" description \u003d \"Moving Stuff Around and Flashing Lights\" /\u003e     \u003cContentNode title \u003d \"Events and Observers\" description \u003d \"Reacting When Stuff Happens\" /\u003e   \u003c/ContentNode\u003e \u003c/LabelList\u003eIn other cases, you can just use the id field to allow you to access the ContentNode node later as an object for any purpose. In both cases, define additional ContentNode nodes with content fields as children of the parent ContentNode node.To create a ContentNode node in BrightScript, you should generally:Create the ContentNode node object using createObject() Create child ContentNode node objects using createChild() Assign the data to the field(s) of each ContentNode child objectAs follows:ContentNode_object \u003d createObject(\"RoSGNode\",\"ContentNode\") ContentNode_child_object \u003d ContentNode_object.createChild(\"ContentNode\") ContentNode_child_object.field_name \u003d data ... Assigning ContentNode Node Data To Nodes/ComponentsFor nodes and components that require a ContentNode node as the specification of their content field, you can define it as a child of the node or component in XML markup using the role attribute, or just assign the ContentNode node object to the content field as follows:NodeComponent.content \u003d ContentNode_objectFor other nodes and components that don\u0027t require a ContentNode node, you can use getChild() or a similar function to locate the specific child ContentNode node object that contains the data you want to assign to a particular node/component field:ContentNode_child_object \u003d ContentNode_object.getChild(child_number) NodeComponent.field_name \u003d ContentNode_child_object.field_nameIf you are assigning a component node field with child elements of a ContentNode node, you should create the ContentNode node and all child elements, then assign the ContentNode node to the component node field. It is more efficient than creating a ContentNode node, assigning the ContentNode node to the component node field, then creating and assigning each child element using getChild(). This is particularly true when creating and assigning ContentNode node data in different threads, which can be very inefficient. Also avoid getting individual data items or child elements repeatedly if it is more efficient to copy the data value locally and avoid the repetitive object accesses, particularly in two different threads.",

      "description": "The PanelSet node provides the panel sliding behavior seen in the Roku home screen. The PanelSet node manages the position of a set of child Panel nodes, and implements the left and right panel sliding behavior. Once a Panel node has been added to a PanelSet node, it remains a child of the PanelSet node unless it is replaced by another Panel node, or slides completely off the right side of the screen.The PanelSet node is designed to display two Panel nodes in most cases, one Panel node on the left and one on the right. When the PanelSet node has focus, and the user presses the Left (or Back) or Right remote control key, the panels slide to the left or right one position.For example, suppose the PanelSet node has two Panel nodes as children, panel A and panel B. When the user presses the Right key, a new panel, panel C, should be created and added as a child of the PanelSet node. Adding a panel as a child of the PanelSet node causes all the panels to slide left one position, so that panel A is now offscreen to the left, panel B is in the left position, and panel C is in the right position. If the user presses the Right key again, a new panel, panel D, should be created and added as a child node of the PanelSet node. Adding panel D causes the panels to slide left again so that panels A and B are offscreen to the left, panel C is in the left position, and panel D is in the right position.At this point, if the user presses the Left key (or Back key), the panels will slide one position to the right, back towards the original home position, so panel D will slide offscreen to the right, panel C will slide to the right position, and panel B will slide to the left position (panel A is still offscreen to the left). When the sliding animation ends, since panel D is offscreen to the right, it is automatically removed as a child node of the PanelSet node.Panel LayoutFor consistency, it is recommended that panels be set to the default height. Similarly, panels should be set to one of four default width sizes. For each panel width, the default defines a corresponding left position for the panel. This is summarized in the table below, along with the default values for each of these fields:Panel Field Panel Size SD Value HD Value height all 403 605 width narrow 218 388   medium 292 520   wide 363 645   full 520 940 leftPosition narrow 60 105   medium 60 105   wide 63 112   full 100 170Narrow panels should be paired with wide panels, so that both panels fit in the alloted region without overlapping the PanelSet node previous and next arrow indicators. Similarly, medium panels should be paired with medium panels. Only one full-screen width panel can be displayed at a time, so full-screen panels cause both left and right panels to slide on/offscreen when they are added to the PanelSet node.When two panels are onscreen, a default gap is added between the left and right panels. For SD, the spacing is set to 20 pixels. For HD, the spacing is 30 pixels. The PanelSet node positions the left panel so that the panel origin is at (leftPosition, 0) in the PanelSet node coordinate system, where leftPosition is the value of the left Panel node leftPosition field. The PanelSet node positions the right panel so that the panel origin is at (leftPosition  leftWidth + spacing), where leftPosition and leftWidth are the left panel leftPosition and width fields, and spacing is the default horizontal spacing attribute.Note that the PanelSet node positions the origin of each Panel node coordinate system by setting the Panel node translation field, but it does not clip the panel to the rectangle defined by the Panel node width and height fields, so if the Panel node contains a child node with translation set to (-10, -5), that child will be rendered 10 pixels to the right and 5 pixels above the panel origin.Child ManagementThe regular roSGNode child management interface, ifSGNodeChildren , is used for adding panels to the PanelSet node. Since adding children to the PanelSet node can trigger the panels to slide left, care must be taken to use those functions in the expected manner.Typically, the first panel is created, the panel focusedChild field has an observer added, then the panel is added to the PanelSet node with appendChild(). Then focus is set on that panel, causing the focusedChild observer function to be called. The focusedChild observer function typically will create the second panel, add a focusedChild observer on that panel, then add the second panel to the PanelSet node with appendChild(), and so forth.If any panel contains a list or grid, the typical usage is that when the list or grid panel is on the left, each list/grid item creates a different panel on the right. Typically, the list or grid itemUnfocused and itemFocused fields are observed. When the itemUnfocused field changes, the list or grid panel will hide the panel on the right, then when the itemFocused field changes, it will create a new panel for the newly focused list or grid item, and call replaceChild() to cause the old panel to be replaced by the new one.The PanelSet node assumes that:Only Panel nodes are added as PanelSet node children Panels are added only using the appendChild() or createChild() roSGNode functions. The Panel node leftPosition field must be set prior to calling appendChild() or createChild(). Appending a child will trigger a PanelSet node slide action in most cases. Panels can be replaced using the replaceChild() roSGNode function. Panel children should never be removed from the PanelSet node using the removeChild() roSGNode function. The PanelSet node automatically removes Panel node children when they slide offscreen to the right. The insertChild() and removeChild() roSGNode functions are never used.",

Since adding children to the PanelSet node can trigger the panels to slide left, care must be taken to use those functions in the expected manner.\u003c/span\u003eTypically, the first panel is created, the panel \u003ccode\u003efocusedChild\u003c/code\u003e field has an observer added, then the panel is added to the \u003cstrong\u003ePanelSet\u003c/strong\u003e node with \u003ccode\u003eappendChild()\u003c/code\u003e. Then focus is set on that panel, causing the \u003ccode\u003efocusedChild\u003c/code\u003e observer function to be called. The \u003ccode\u003efocusedChild\u003c/code\u003e observer function typically will create the second panel, add a \u003ccode\u003efocusedChild\u003c/code\u003e observer on that panel, then add the second panel to the \u003cstrong\u003ePanelSet\u003c/strong\u003e node with \u003ccode\u003eappendChild()\u003c/code\u003e, and so forth.If any panel contains a list or grid, the typical usage is that when the list or grid panel is on the left, each list/grid item creates a different panel on the right. Typically, the list or grid \u003ccode\u003eitemUnfocused\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eitemFocused\u003c/code\u003e fields are observed. When the\u0026nbsp;\u003ccode\u003eitemUnfocused\u003c/code\u003e field changes, the list or grid panel will hide the panel on the right, then when the\u0026nbsp;\u003ccode\u003eitemFocused\u003c/code\u003e field changes, it will create a new panel for the newly focused list or grid item, and call \u003ccode\u003ereplaceChild()\u003c/code\u003e to cause the old panel to be replaced by the new one.The \u003cstrong\u003ePanelSet\u003c/strong\u003e node assumes that:\u003cli\u003eOnly \u003cstrong\u003ePanel\u003c/strong\u003e nodes are added as \u003cstrong\u003ePanelSet\u003c/strong\u003e node children\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePanels are added only using the \u003ccode\u003eappendChild()\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003ecreateChild()\u003c/code\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eroSGNode\u003c/strong\u003e functions.

This mechanism is enabled or disabled by setting the createNextPanelOnItemFocus field to true or false.createNextPanelOnItemFocus should be set to true when a new right panel should be displayed each time the grid\u0027s focused item changes. For example, in the Roku Homescreen, when you navigate up/down/left/right in Streaming Channels grid, a new right panel is displayed that contains information about the currently focused grid item. createNextPanelOnItemFocus should be set to false when the right panel should not change in response to the grid\u0027s focus changes. For example, when focus is on the installed channels grid in the Roku Homescreen, the right panel always displays an ad panel, regardless of which item is focused in the grid.When the create next panel mechanism is enabled and the user presses a navigation arrow key, the panel to the right of the GridPanel smoothly fades out, then when the user releases the arrow key, a new right panel is created, added to the PanelSet and smoothly faded in. To implement this, the GridPanel automatically triggers the fade out of the right panel when the navigation arrow key is pressed. When the arrow key is released, the GridPanel will set the createNextPanelIndex field to the index into the grid\u0027s content that corresponds to the newly focused grid item. In response to the createNextPanelIndex field being set, the GridPanel\u0027s control logic must be written to immediately create the Panel node for the new right panel and set the nextPanel field to that Panel. The Panel creation must occur in the main scene graph render thread.The createNextPanelIndex field is guaranteed to be set exactly once whenever a new right panel needs to be created and populated with the data that corresponds to the specified index. This may happen when the GridPanel\u0027s data is changed, in response to up or down arrow key releases, or when the PanelSet\u0027s moves the focus onto the GridPanel from the left.For efficiency, sometimes the control logic for the GridPanel may create and hold onto Panel pointers internally so that the next Panel does not have to be newly created each the createNextPanelIndex field is set. If this is done, it is important to never reuse the current Panel node, as that Panel may still be fading out when the new next Panel needs to be created. A typical use case, where all the right Panels are identical other than the data they display, is to create a single pair of Panel nodes and alternate between them each time the createNextPanelIndex field is set, updating the panel data based on the specified list index.",

      "description": "The MaskGroup node class allows an alpha mask bitmap to be applied to the rendering of its children. This allows effects such as having a list fade out at the bottom to be easily created.MaskGroup nodes do not work on all Roku players (specifically, MaskGroup nodes only work on players that support OpenGL). On players whose graphics do not support OpenGL, a MaskGroup node just renders its children without applying the extra alpha mask. For this reason, you should avoid using the MaskGroup node for anything other than decorative purposes, such as creating a fading effect at the bottom of the screen, where the user interface information value of the screen element is not affected by the lack of the MaskNode node rendering.Unlike other bitmaps, the MaskGroup node class does not work with 9-patch images. If the bitmap size does not match the group bounding rectangle, the edge rows of the mask are repeated as needed.For example, suppose the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle has an origin at (0, 0), a width of 150 and a height of 80. If the mask bitmap were also 150 by 80, and the maskOffset and maskSize field values were left at their default values of [ 0, 0 ], then each pixel of the mask bitmap would be applied to the corresponding pixel of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The figure below illustrates that case. On the right is a MaskGroup node that contains a Poster node. In the center is an alpha bitmap with the same size as the Poster node. On the right is the result of rendering the MaskGroup node with the image in the center used as a mask. The maskSize and maskOffset field values can be used to scale and offset the mask bitmap relative to the group coordinate system, as shown in the figure below. The mask is the same bitmap as in the figure above. In the below figure, the maskOffset field value has been set to (50, 30), offsetting the origin of the mask bitmap coordinate system relative to the origin of the MaskGroup node coordinate system 50 pixels to the left and 30 pixels down.The maskSize field value has been set to (100, 50), This causes the width of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 150 to 100, and the height of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 80 to 50, so that the mask right edge aligns with the right edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle, and the mask bottom edge aligns with the bottom edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The center of the figure shows the mask with the maskOffset and maskSize field values applied overlaid on top of the MaskGroup node. The right side of the figure shows the result of applying the mask to the MaskGroup node. Notice that the left column of pixels in the mask is used as the mask for all columns of the MaskGroup node that lie to the left of the mask, causing those columns to be rendered with full opacity. Similarly, and the top row of the mask is used as the mask for all rows of the MaskGroup node that lie above the mask, causing each of the rows to fade out on the right.  As shown in above, the transformed mask may not overlay all the rendered pixels of the MaskGroup node. In that case, the leftmost (rightmost) columns of the mask bitmap are used as the mask for any MaskGroup node pixels that are to the left (right) of the transformed mask.

This allows effects such as having a list fade out at the bottom to be easily created.\u003cac:rich-text-body\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e nodes do not work on all Roku\u0026nbsp;players (specifically, \n \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e nodes only work on\u0026nbsp;players that support OpenGL). On\u0026nbsp;players whose graphics do not support OpenGL, a \n \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node just renders its children without applying the extra alpha mask. For this reason, you should avoid using the \n \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node for anything other than decorative purposes, such as creating a fading effect at the bottom of the screen, where the user interface information value of the screen element is not affected by the lack of the \n \u003cstrong\u003eMaskNode\u003c/strong\u003e node rendering.\n\u003c/ac:rich-text-body\u003eUnlike other bitmaps, the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node class does not work with 9-patch images. If the bitmap size does not match the group bounding rectangle, the edge rows of the mask are repeated as needed.For example, suppose the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node\u0026nbsp;bounding rectangle has an origin at (0, 0), a width of 150 and a height of 80. If the mask bitmap were also 150 by 80, and the \u003ccode\u003emaskOffset\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003emaskSize\u003c/code\u003e field values were left at their default values of \u003ccode\u003e[ 0, 0\u0026nbsp;]\u003c/code\u003e, then each pixel of the mask bitmap would be applied to the corresponding pixel of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node bounding rectangle. The figure below illustrates that case. On the right is a \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node that contains a \u003cstrong\u003ePoster\u003c/strong\u003e node. In the center is an alpha bitmap with the same size as the \u003cstrong\u003ePoster\u003c/strong\u003e node. On the right is the result of rendering the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node with the image in the center used as a mask.\u003cac:image ac:align\u003d\"center\"\u003e\n \u003cri:attachment ri:filename\u003d\"maskExample1.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/ac:image\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003emaskSize\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003emaskOffset\u003c/code\u003e field values can be used to scale and offset the mask bitmap relative to the group coordinate system, as shown in the figure below. The mask is the same bitmap as in the figure above. In the below figure, the \u003ccode\u003emaskOffset\u003c/code\u003e field value has been set to (50, 30), offsetting the origin of the mask bitmap coordinate system relative to the origin of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node\u0026nbsp;coordinate system 50 pixels to the left and 30 pixels down.The \u003ccode\u003emaskSize\u003c/code\u003e field value has been set to (100, 50), This causes the width of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 150 to 100, and the height of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 80 to 50, so that the mask right edge aligns with the right edge of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node\u0026nbsp;bounding rectangle, and the mask bottom edge aligns with the bottom edge of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node\u0026nbsp;bounding rectangle. The center of the figure shows the mask with the \u003ccode\u003emaskOffset\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003emaskSize\u003c/code\u003e field values applied overlaid on top of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node. The right side of the figure shows the result of applying the mask to the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node. Notice that the left column of pixels in the mask is used as the mask for all columns of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node that lie to the left of the mask, causing those columns to be rendered with full opacity. Similarly, and the top row of the mask is used as the mask for all rows of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node that lie above the mask, causing each of the rows to fade out on the right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n \u003cac:image ac:align\u003d\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cri:attachment ri:filename\u003d\"maskExample2.png\" /\u003e\n \u003c/ac:image\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan\u003eAs shown in above, the transformed mask may not overlay all the rendered pixels of the \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node. In that case, the leftmost (rightmost) columns of the mask bitmap are used as the mask for any \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node pixels that are to the left (right) of the transformed mask. The top (bottom) row of the mask bitmap is used as the mask for \u003cstrong\u003eMaskGroup\u003c/strong\u003e node pixels that are above (below) the transformed mask.\u003c/span\u003e",

If the deltaOrder field was then set to: { \"code\": \"MyItem2\", \"qty\": 1 } The order field ContentNode node would have a second ContentNode node child appended to it, with the specified \"code\" and \"qty\" field values. The \"qty\" field can be set to a negative value to remove an item from an order. For example, if the order field was set as above, and the deltaOrder field was set to: { \"code\" MyItem2\", \"qty\": -1 } The order field ContentNode node would have the second child ContentNode node removed.",

You can apply a specified interpolator function to either or both ease-in and ease-out, or specify no function for either or both (which is the linear function).
